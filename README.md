# Feature-Branch-Workflow

The Feature Branch Workflow still uses a central repository, and master still represents the official project history. But, instead of committing directly on their local master branch, developers create a new branch every time they start work on a new feature.Aside from isolating feature development, branches make it possible to discuss changes via pull requests. Once someone completes a feature, they donâ€™t immediately merge it into master. Instead, they push the feature branch to the central server and file a pull request asking to merge their additions into master. This gives other developers an opportunity to review the changes before they become a part of the main codebase.
